# R Scripts

These are the R scripts that I have used to do some preliminary data processing.

## NEjoin.R

This program essentially does the same thing as NEjoin.sh, which is match the neanderthal files with the rsID files, but does so using R.

## remColumns.R

This program removes the first column, which is just the numbered lines from the individual rsID chormosome files.
