## CallTissueMergeR.sh
	This is the bash script that loads R and invokes the R file. Note that I did not make use of SLURM's multi-job capabilities because I could not figure out how to and I just wanted to get the job done and move past this point.

## TissueMerge.R
	This script works on the neanderthal rsID files and the altrans tissue data to generate output files that are the merged product of the tissue data and neanderthal rsID data. (Started 10-4-2018)
