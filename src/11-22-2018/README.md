##ConvertToBam.sh
	It's Thanksgiving (Happy Thanksgiving). I wrote a little ditty in Bash that converts the .sra RNA-Seq GTEx files obtained from dbGaP to .bam to be used with LeafCutter. I used NCBI's SRA-Toolkit page on sam-dump (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc&f=sam-dump) as a reference.
