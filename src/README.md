## src
This directory contains all of the scripts used in calling and mapping GTEx v7 sQTLs.
* **AWS** were scripts that were run on Amazon Web Services or process the outputs of AWS scripts (i.e. JUNC files generated from AWS)
* **primary** contains the bulk of what we used to produce and analyze results. This directory is subdivided into `R/` and `sh/`.
