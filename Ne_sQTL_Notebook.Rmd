Our present goal, as of the aforementioned date, is to find both splicing transcripts that are far more abundantly expressed in individuals who are at least heterozygous for the Neandertal allele where they have some (modest) transcript counts for the modern human allele (quantitative), and splicing transcripts that are altogether novel and uniquely expressed in individuals that are at least heterozygous for the Neandertal allele where they have 0 (zero) counts for the modern human allele. The findings from these two analyses will be presented in two different sections in the manuscript. 

What we have so far is a merged table with columns representing `variant_id`, `transcript_id`, genotype (so `0`, `1`, or `2` for homozygous modern human, heterozygous, and homozygous archaic, respectively), and `counts`. We pursued an avenue where we consolidated rows with identical `variant_id`/`transcript_id` pairs, filtered the tables, then made them horizontal, then we went back and did the same thing without filtering, found the difference in average counts per sample between the `HH` and `NN` transcripts, and looked for transcripts where there are fewer than 100 counts for the homozygous modern human genotype and greater than 250 counts for the homozygous archaic genotype.

Now, we are retooling our analysis. We're reconstructing our `merge_table` table to also include `sample_id`, so that we can filter instances where a homozygous modern human genotype results in the expression of 0 counts of a transcript **except** in one or two individuals who might have been misannotated, although, I'm not quite sure why we're doing that because we are going to discard those `variant_id`/`transcript_id` pairs anyway. But what we ultimately want is to

  1. Isolate instances where there is a novel NL transcript resulting from an sQTL (so no human expression but even some heterozygous NL expression)
  2. Isolate instances where there is a marked increase in gene expression in the NL genotypes

From Steph:
```
I’m still trying to think of the best way to filter for interesting things in this data. I guess in the ideal situation we’d have:
- All HH samples are 0
- If a few HH samples are nonzero, their expression is very low
- All heterozygous human samples have nonzero expression
- All NLNL samples also have nonzero expression
but probably it’ll be easiest to just filter by the first criteria to begin with
```
I was able to regenerate the tables to include the individual ID (e.g. `GTEX-XXXX`) for each tissue.

I've spent hours agonizing over how to get the GTEX ID for each row to show up in `merge_tables.R` before realizing that it's not important right now. I'm going back to the horizontalized tables (pre-difference, I hope any of this makes sense when you read it) and I'm filtering for cases where all HH = 0 for any particular `variant_id` and `transcript_id` pair. Man I'm hungry right now.

Here's the path for the directory that is important and I should focus on: `/work-zfs/rmccoy22/aseyedi2/tempData/merge/old_attempt/final_iso/horizontal`

### 01/30/2020

Finally found those doggone Neandertal-specific isoforms. They're in `NoHHIsoforms.txt`. The code is in `test.R`. The names are bad, I know, but I just had to put down something because I have to go to the lab. We found over 16k sQTLs with 0 human transcripts and more than 0 Neandertal transcripts. This should be interesting.

Rajiv has asked me to use a software tool developed by Dr. Joshua Akey that does not require an outgroup population, unlike SPrime, as far as I can tell. In order to prep the GTEx VCF, I need to remove indels and multiallelic SNPs, which I will do using `vcftools`:

```
vcftools 
  --vcf {input} \
  --max-alleles 2 \
  --remove-indels \
  --recode \
  --out {output}
```

This is for the admixed MH VCF. I need to find the archaic VCF, but in order to do that, I have to find out more about it as an input into IBDMix.

In order to download the Neandertal VCF, I have to do the following:
```
for i in {1..22}; do
  wget "http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/altai/AltaiNeandertal/VCF/AltaiNea.hg19_1000g.${i}.mod.vcf.gz"
done

for i in {1..22}; do
  gunzip AltaiNea.hg19_1000g.${i}.mod.vcf.gz
done

# Find out a way to "zcat AltaiNea.hg19_1000g.${i}.mod.vcf.gz >> MergedAltaiNL.mod.vcf" without colliding the headers
```

Steph and I are also meeting with Rajiv later to discuss the results of the NL-specific sQTLs that we found. Apparently the results do not open an interesting line of inquiry according to Steph. We will see.
