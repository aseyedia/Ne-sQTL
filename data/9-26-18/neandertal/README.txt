Here are the lists of Neandertal tag SNPs, based on S* haplotype calls from European 1000 Genomes populations. The columns in the file are: chromosome, position - 1, position, ancestral allele, derived allele, Altai Neandertal allele. The coordinates are based on hg19. I am also attaching a file where I have intersected with protein-coding genes (including intronic regions), based on GENCODE v19.
