enrichment funciton
	- We are finding random sets of non-NL introgressed SNPs that have a similar frequency to the NL-introgressed SNPs and determining how many of them are significant to build a null distribution. We then take the signficant NL-introgressed SNPs and determine where they lie along the distribution. Permuations are the testing of the random set of SNPs.

From nominal pass column, take `uniq` - that SNP will have an associated frequency

From the VCF, grab all the SNPs that are in the nominal pass file so then you'll have frequency annotated with NL from SPrime

do this for every permutation to find frequency matched SNPs

Use `pymatch` or `Matching` for frequency matching

Develop seed method for random permutation - set default seed
